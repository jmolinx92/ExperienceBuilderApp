<h1>Welcome to the National Endangered Species Act (ESA) Critical Habitat Mapper (v1.0) by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)!</h1>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; line-height: 1.8; font-size: large">This interactive tool is intended to assist the public and Federal action agencies in viewing critical habitat spatial data; however, please refer to the description and boundaries of each critical habitat designation provided in the proposed or final rule and Code of Federal Regulations (50 CFR 226). For instructions on how to use this mapper, please click on the User Guide icon above.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; line-height: 1.8; font-size: large">This version of the National NMFS ESA Critical Habitat Mapper may not yet include spatial data for recently proposed or designated critical habitat. Additionally, spatial data are not yet available for the designated critical habitat of the Southern Oregon/Northern California Coast coho salmon and the Snake River spring/summer-run chinook salmon. NMFS will add these spatial data as soon as possible. In the meantime, please consult the applicable rule or CFR.</p>

<p style="font-family:Times New Roman; line-height: 1.8; font-size: large">Critical habitat maps and spatial data in this mapper may be modified or clarified by regulatory text as provided in the rules and CFR. Final critical habitat rules and the CFR also describe any areas that are excluded from designation or otherwise not part of a designation, some of which may still appear in the spatial data. This mapper can be used as a first step in determining if a proposed federal action overlaps with or may affect designated critical habitat. Even if the data indicate critical habitat is not present in the action area, the Federal action agency should contact the appropriate NMFS Office to discuss whether the proposed action may affect any designated or proposed critical habitat. Critical habitat spatial data may include both lines (representing rivers, streams, and beaches) and polygons (representing waterbodies, marine areas, estuaries, and marshes). Both line and polygon data must be selected to represent <strong>all available NOAA Fisheriesâ€™ critical habitat spatial data.</strong></p>
